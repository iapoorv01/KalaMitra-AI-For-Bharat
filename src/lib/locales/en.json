      "formationTitle": "How KalaMitra Was Formed",
      "formationBody": "KalaMitra began as an inspiring vision by Apoorv Gupta and Mradul Gupta, founders of Team ThinkTech, who decided to solve the real problems artisans face today.",
      "visionBody": "In the world of an evolving Aatma Nirbhar Bharat – a self-reliant country, a vision ignited by our Hon’ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi – one thing is clear: India’s cultural strength lies in the hands of its artisans. But this challenge is not limited to India. Across the world, local artisans face the same struggle.",
      "challengeBody": "Whether it’s about receiving the fair price their craft truly deserves, or depending upon middlemen, local stalls, or seasonal markets, artisans often earn only a fraction of the value of their work. But it’s not just the makers who struggle—buyers are losing out, too. Because the connection is broken, buyers get mass-produced items, and artisans stay sidelined.",
      "solutionBody": "That’s where KalaMitra comes in. KalaMitra is an AI-powered cultural marketplace — a digital companion for artisans, buyers, and cultural brands. It removes the biggest barriers to self-reliance. Whether it’s tackling capital with the opportunity to create and sell virtual products from our own app with zero investment, or creating useful products for selling from donated & leftover items and waste materials!",
      "experienceBody": "It’s not only about artisans. Buyers get a rich, immersive experience through stories, voice interaction, AR visualization, and direct connection with creators.",
      "livingHubBody": "Unlike traditional marketplaces, KalaMitra is not static. It’s a living cultural hub — with AI, 3D bazaars, auctions, collaborations, and community features — all in one place.",
